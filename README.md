## Description:

Well howdy fellow Rimworlders!  
I’m here to present to you the latest technology in mind altering … technology.  
Erhum…  
Are you tired of your lousy traits?  
Pessimist are you? Lazy perhaps? Maybe a bit abrasive?

Unpleasant adulthood?  
Change it now!

## Honest Description:

This mod was just a test to see how far I could go with Rimworld code and my limited knowledge of C#.  
The code is not optimized and is held together with proficient amount of ducktape.  
The video might be an exaggeration but I couldn’t resist taking the joke a bit further.  

So it's basically a machine, closely resembling the cryptosleep casket.  
Order your colonist to step inside and wait for the process to finish.  
Your colonist will now have 2 or 3 new random generated traits.  
There are side effects to this of course. (you wouldn’t want it to be overpowered would you?)  
Closely examine your colonist for any health issues or mood swings before using the device multiple times in a row.  
Don’t say I didn’t warn you!  

## Incompatibilities:  
Minor issue:  
CommunityCoreLibrary ~The actual lighting of the MAD will not work due to CCL overriding CompGlower.
